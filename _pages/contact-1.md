# Welcome Test

Hi! My name is _Ruben Janssen_, I'm specialized in Front-End Development or Front-End Engineering as some people like to say. My main focus and passion is creating the user interaction and visual interface with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript.

This website is build using Jekyll and Netlify for the CI (Continuous Integration). I've been using CI builds for quite some time now, within [TFS](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/tfs/){:data-title="TFS"  rel="noopener"} and [DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/nl-nl/overview/devops/){:data-title="DevOps" rel="noopener"}.
