I started sharing posts about projects, so why not share what I use. There are [quite a lot examples out there](https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses){:data-title="quite a lot examples out there"}.

I'll try to keep it up to date but I haven't added all items from my company machine yet. So more updates coming in the near future... 🎆

## 📝 Editor

* [Atom](https://atom.io/){:data-title="Atom"}, still very fond of this little editor.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:data-title="Visual Studio Code} Just to see what te fuzz is all about. Can't get used to the quirky navigation panel though.

### 🔌 Main plugins

* [file-icons](https://atom.io/packages/file-icons){:data-title="file-icons"} Basic file icon set that works well with my dark theme's
* [atom-beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify){:data-title="atom-beautify"} Sometimes you just need something to clean up your mess. 😇
* [color-picker](https://atom.io/packages/color-picker){:data-title="color-picker"} just because I don't use designs on some of my personal projects it comes in handy.

### 🎨 Visual

* Theme [DuoTone dark amethyst](https://atom.io/themes/duotone-dark-amethyst-syntax){:data-title="DuoTone dark amethyst"} Because I'm a sucker for dark mode and dark themes.
* Font [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode){:data-title="Fira Code"}. I only started using this font recently. Not sure if it's a keeper. The operators look really nice it's a bit hard in day-to-day use. Maybe I have to get used to it though.

## ⬛️ Terminal

* [iTerm 2](https://iterm2.com/){:data-title="iTerm 2"} because configuration & personalisation is key.
* [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/){:data-title="oh my zsh"} because more (easy) personalisation
* [Meslo powerline font](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/blob/master/Meslo%20Slashed/Meslo%20LG%20M%20Regular%20for%20Powerline.ttf){:data-title="Meslo powerline font"}
* [Agnoster](https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme){:data-title="Agnoster"} zsh theme

I also use a custom zsh config, I'll dedicate a post to that later 🙃

## 🖥 Desktop Apps

* [Alfred 4](https://www.alfredapp.com/){:data-title="Alfred 4"} the ultimate spotligt alternative
* [Dato](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/dato/id1470584107?l=en&mt=12){:data-title="Dato"} For quick access to my calendar.
* [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/developer/){:data-title="Firefox Developer Edition"}
* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/new/){:data-title="Firefox}
* [Coda 2](https://panic.com/coda/){:data-title="Coda 2"} For the times I still need an (s)ftp tool
* [1 Password](https://1password.com/){:data-title="1 Password"} (for now) Used it for many years, bought multiple versions. Only thing is they don't offer licenses anymore, only subscriptions. So I might consider going for a new password manager.
* [CleanMyMac X](https://macpaw.com/cleanmymac){:data-title="CleanMyMac X"} Just an easy way to keep it all cluter free
* [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/){:data-title="Spotify"} 
* [MacOS Catalina](https://www.apple.com/macos/){:data-title="MacOS Catalina"} software
  * Mail
  * Notes
  * Calendar
  * Photos
  * Home
