I started sharing posts about projects, so why not share what I use. There are [quite a lot examples out there](https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses){:data-title="quite a lot examples out there"}. 

## Editor

* [Atom](https://atom.io/){:data-title="Atom"}, still very fond of this little editor.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:data-title="Visual Studio Code} Just to see what te fuzz is all about. Can't get used to the quirky navigation panel though.

### Main plugins

* [file-icons](https://atom.io/packages/file-icons){:data-title="file-icons"} Basic file icon set that works well with my dark theme's
* [atom-beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify){:data-title="atom-beautify"} Sometimes you just need something to clean up your mess. ðŸ˜‡
* [color-picker](https://atom.io/packages/color-picker){:data-title="color-picker"} just because I don't use designs on some of my personal projects it comes in handy.

### Visual

* Theme [DuoTone dark amethyst](https://atom.io/themes/duotone-dark-amethyst-syntax){:data-title="DuoTone dark amethyst"} Because I'm a sucker for dark mode and dark themes.
* Font [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode){:data-title="Fira Code"}. I only started using this font recently. Not sure if it's a keeper. The operators look really nice it's a bit hard in day-to-day use. Maybe I have to get used to it though.
