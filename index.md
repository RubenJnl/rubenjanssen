## Welcome

Hi! My name is _Ruben Janssen_, I'm specialized in Front-End Development or Front-End Engineering as some people like to say.
My main focus and passion is creating the user interaction and visual interface with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript.

This website is build using Jekyll and Netlify with  CI (Continuous Integration).
I also know a bit about PHP, C# and .NET and MySQL and XML, this makes the communication with other (back-end) developers a piece of cake.

I've been experimenting with a lot of (new) techniques, sometimes I put them online, like parallax scrolling with CSS only. You can find it at my Lab section: [lab.rubenjanssen.nl/parallax](https://lab.rubenjanssen.nl/parallax). Make sure to use a modern browser though! ;-)
