Last weekend I made just another trip on my [BMW Motorcycle](https://bmwboxer.nl){:data-title="BMW Motorcycle"} and logged my trip with [Scenic by MotorMappers](https://www.motomappers.com/){:data-title="Scenic by MotorMappers"}, almost as usual when I go for a ride longer then an hour.
Sometimes I post about a trip, like te previous trip with a large group. I made a video, some pictures and a log of the route. I added the log as a screenshot to the post.

Sunday I thought this could be different/better, there are so many great API's to use. Lets see if I can render my <abbr title="GPS Exchange format, an XML scheme for sharing route information.">gpx</abbr> file on a map along my post.

For my [Lab API testpage](https://lab.rubenjanssen.nl/api){:data-title="Lab API testpage"} I already used Google Static maps and currently Mapbox to display the user's location.
